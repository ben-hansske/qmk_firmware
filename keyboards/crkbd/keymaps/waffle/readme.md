# Waffle's CRKBD Custom Layout

- This is my take on an optimal 40% keyboard layout. I have been working at this for a few months now and it feels complete to me. I hope you find something useful in here as well!
- My layout is optimized for using five columns for all alpha and modifier keys. 

## OLED Displays
- On the secondary half, there is an animated bongo cat according to your WPM. And on the master half, there is a numeric WPM display, a QMK logo, and a terminal themed layer indicator.
- I also like to thank everyone in the community who has helped with various pieces of this.

## Flashing
- Flashing using `make crkbd:waffle:avrdude` for Pro Micros and `make crkbd:waffle:dfu` for Elite-C's.
